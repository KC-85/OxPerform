# OxPerform (Oxfordshire)

## Overall Vision

A moderated, county-wide hub for open-mic events (music, comedy, spoken word, jams) initially (Pilot), across Oxfordshire,
with simple submissions for organisers, easy discovery for performers/audiences, and reliable listings.

- **Note:** If the pilot works, then we will open up to all performing arts across Oxfordshire.

This will become the single source for "what's on" in Oxfordshire's grassroots scene.

### Goals & Success Metrics

#### Primary Goals

- Centralise event discovery for the county
- Lower friction for organisers to publish accurate events
- Build trust via light moderation & verification

#### Success Metrics

- 20+ approved events published
- 10+ unique organisers posting
- 250 monthly unique visitors/2+ pages per session
- Email digest CTR => 15%, bounce rate <35%

### Advertising & Sponsorship (High-Level)

#### Purpose:
- Generate a small, transparent revenue stream that supports hosting, email delivery, backups, and ongoing maintenance of OxPerform, while keeping the platform community-first and uncluttered.

#### Advertising Approach (Pilot Phase)

- Introduce a limited number of static, non-tracking sponsor placements.
- All ads are clearly labelled “Sponsored” or “Advertisement” to comply with ASA/CAP guidelines.
- Focus exclusively on local (some regional) sponsors during the pilot:

- pubs, venues, rehearsal studios
- music shops, creative businesses
- local newspapers and county-wide news sites
- arts organisations, community groups
- small service businesses
- No ad networks (Google Ads, programmatic) during MVP.

#### Placement Strategy

##### During MVP + pilot, use three lightweight placements:

- Homepage Slot
- A single rectangular banner after several event cards.
- High visibility but not intrusive.
- Event Detail Sidebar Slot
- Appears on the event page, beneath event information.
- Contextual and useful for local businesses.
- Sitewide Footer Slot
- A small sponsored-line or banner.
- Always accessible without disrupting the browsing experience.
- Each slot remains uncluttered, with a maximum of one ad per area.

#### Sponsor Types & Target Outreach

- Ideal sponsors during pilot:
- local newspapers (Faringdon, Oxfordshire, regional news sites)
- cafés, pubs, entertainment venues
- creative agencies (e.g., Envious Digital)
- performance spaces, theatres, galleries
- community magazines & newsletters
- local radio (BBC Radio Oxford community partners)
- The goal is to build mutually supportive local relationships.

#### Pricing Model (Pilot)

##### Use a simple, predictable, monthly flat-fee model:

##### This is to keep the site running (ongoing maintenance)

- £10–£15 per month (introductory rate).
- Discounts possible for multi-slot or multi-month commitments.
- No long contracts — cancellations allowed with short notice.
- This keeps the revenue model fair, accessible, and community-friendly.

#### Sponsor Assets & Requirements

- Static image banner (JPG/PNG/WebP).
- Short accessible alt text.
- Click-through URL containing basic UTM tags.
- Sponsor must follow a content policy (no political, adult, misleading, or inappropriate ads).
- Ads must visually match the site’s aesthetic (no flashing or disruptive graphics).

#### Tracking & Reporting

- For MVP, use lightweight impression estimates (page views) and click counts.

##### Provide sponsors with a simple monthly summary:

- estimated impressions
- clicks
- click-through rate
- Privacy-respecting analytics only (e.g., Plausible or Matomo).

#### Transparency & Trust

##### Add a brief disclosure on the Support page:

- “OxPerform includes clearly labelled sponsor placements to help cover hosting and maintenance costs. Sponsored content never influences event listings or moderation decisions.”

- No behavioural targeting or tracking cookies during MVP.
- All ads must remain secondary to the community content.

#### Future Expansion (v1.0+)

##### After the pilot, consider enhancing the advertising system:

- Addition of AEO in tandem with traditional SEO **(Starting from v1.0)**.
- A simple Ad model for uploading banners and links via admin.
- Optional scheduling (start/end dates).
- Additional sponsor slots on town pages or category pages.
- Rotating banners if demand grows.
- Later: optional geo-targeted ads (e.g., “sponsors in Oxford only”) based on user filtering.
- Optional “Featured Event” paid upgrades (clearly marked).
- Still community-first — ads must remain minimal and tasteful.
- If growth is sufficient over a set period of time, then Google Ads will be considered.

#### Long-Term Vision (v2+ - around 18 months after v1.0)

- Build a small advertiser dashboard for sponsors (view their stats).
- Offer county-wide campaigns for local media and arts organisations.
- Collaborate with local digital agencies (e.g., Envious Digital) on creative design.
- Maintain strict editorial independence and fairness in moderation.
- If possible, a complete rewrite in either Node.js or PHP(Wordpress)/Laravel for performance & efficiency.

### Audience & Personas

- **Venue Owner/Organizer (Person 1):** Needs fast event submission, editing and simple verification.
- **Performer (Person 2):** Filters by town/category/date; wants .ics add-to-calendar; may subscribe to towns.
- **Audience Member (Person 3):** Wants "Tonight/This Week lists; mobile-friendly browsing.
- **Moderator/Admin (Person 4):** Needs an efficient approval queue and anti-spam tools.

## Scope

### MVP (4-6 weeks)

- Event submission (guest or logged-in), email verification, moderation queue.
- Public list (cards) with filters: **Town, Category, Date, Search.**
- Event detail with .ics download and organiser contact relay form.
- Auto-archive past events (Celery).
- Weekly "What's On" email digest (opt-in subscribers).
- Bootstrap 5 UI; HTMX for filters/pagination; Postgres FTS for search.
- Anti-abuse: Cloudflare Turnstile, rate limit (may add Axes), basic bad-word filter.

### v1.0 (8-12 weeks(after thorough testing))

- Subscriptions: By town and/or category, double opt-in + unsubscribe link.
- Featured events basic analytics (views) per event.
- Venue/Town directory page; CSV export for organisers.
- Public JSON feed (Read-Only) of upcoming events.

### Out of scope/later additions

- Ticketing (MVP if needed), seat maps, two-way calendar sync, performer profiles, reviews/ratings.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** P95 page load < 1.5s on 4G/5G; list queries P95 < 300ms.
- **Availability:** => 99.5% monthly (single-node acceptable for development).
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA; full keyboard navigation; alt text required.
- **Security:** HTTPS everywhere; OWASP Top 10 mitigations, data minimisation.
- **Privacy:** GDPR-compliant (lawful basis, retention limits, unsubscribe).
- **Portability:** Dockerised/K3s local/production parity.

## Information Architecture & URLs

### Public

- / Home: Upcoming events list (filters + "Load more").
- `/e/<uuid>/` - Event detail (+ Add to Calendar .ics).
- `/submit/` - Submit event (guest or user).
- `/verify-email/?token...` - Verify guest email.
- `/subscribe/` - Subscribe to digest(towm/category).
- `/unsubscribe/?token...` - One-click unsubscribe.
- `/towns/` - List towns; each links to filtered view.
- `/feed/upcoming.json` - Read-only JSON feed (v1.0).

### Moderation (protected)

- `/moderation/` - Pending queue (cards with Approve/Reject).
- `/moderation/events/<uuid>/approve` (POST).
- `/moderation/events/<uuid>/reject` (POST).

### HTMX Partials

- `/events/partial-list/` - Returns grid + updated "Load more" button.
- `/moderation/partial-queue/` - Returns current queue.

## Data Model (first pass)

### Entities

#### Event

- `id (UUID, PK), title (140), description (Text), category (music|comedy|spoken|jam|other)`
- `venue_name (140), address (240), town (FK Town, nullable), postcode (10)`
- `start_at (datetime), end_at (datetime)`
- `organiser_name (120), organiser_email (email)`
- `image (optional), status (PENDING|PUBLISHED|REJECTED|ARCHIVED)`
- `email_verified (bool), created_by (FK, User, nullable)`
- **TImestamps:** `published_at, created_at, updated_at`
- **Search:** `search_vector (tsvector)` **+ GIN index**

#### Town

#### Subscription

- `email, town (FK, nullable), category (nullable)`
- `verified (bool), token (unique), created_at`

#### Abuse Report

#### Indexes

- `Event(status, start_at), Event(category), Event(town)`**, GIN ON** `search_vector`

#### Retention

- Archive past events immediately; hard delete images + PII after 180 days unless legal holds.

## Key Workflows

### Submission (guest)

- Guest fills `/submit/` + Turnstile -> **PENDING**, `email_verified=False`
- Email with signed token -> `/verify-email/?token...`
- After verify -> stays **PENDING** until moderator approval
- Moderator approves -> **PUBLISHED**, `published_at` set; confirmation email

### Submission (logged-in)

- Auth user submits -> **PENDING** (`email_verified=True`)
- Moderator approves -> **PUBLISHED**

### Moderation 

- Queue shows newest first; Approve/Reject inline (HTMX).
- Block approval if guest not verified.
- Bulk actions for power-mods (Admin).

### Archival

- Celery job hourly: `end_at < now()` -> `status=ARCHIVED`.

### Subscriptions

- User submits email (+ optional town/category) -> verify link -> weekly digest Mon 09:00

### Abuse Reporting

- Detail page -> Report -> mod inbox/queue -> mark Reviewed/Dismissed.

## UI/UX (CSS(Minimal), JavaScript(Minimal), Bootstrap 5 + HTMX)

### Intent

- Keep custom styling and scripting as light as possible
- Bootstrap covers the UI; HTMX handles interactivity.
- Custom CSS/JS is limited to small helpers that improve usability, accessibility and perceived performance.

### UI/UX scope

- Use Bootstrap 5 as the primary design system (layout, components, utilities).
- Use HTMX for all dynamic interactions (filters, paginations, moderation actions).
- Add a small custom CSS file for a few utility classes (e.g., consistent card image aspect, subtle line-clamping for excerpts, visible focus outline, and a simple loading overlay for HTMX targets).
-Add a small JS "glue" file for: CSRF header on HTMX requests, a basic confirm dialog for destructive actions, make Bootstrap cards dynamic on mouse hover, and optional Bootstrap toasts triggered by server responses.

### File Structure

- One minimal CSS file for utility rules only (Maybe site-wide fonts/colours).
- One minimal JS file for HTMX/Bootstrap glue only.
- Optional: One tiny "app init" JS file if we later enable Bootstrap tooltips or similar niceties.

### Usage Patterns

- Listing pages: Use HTMX to update the grid when filters change or on "Load more". The loading overlay appears only on the affected container; content remains readable.
- Moderation queue: Approve/Reject actions dispatch small HTMX requests; responses may trigger a toast notification (success/error).
- Forms: Rely on Bootstrap validation states; JS only prevents double submission on long operations if needed.

### Accessibility

- Ensure visible focus outlines and keyboard navigability across filters, buttons, and links.
- Provide alt text for all images and meaningful labels for form controls.
- Keep interactions usable without JavaScript; HTMX enhances but does not block basic navigation and form submission.
- WCAG everything.

### Performance and UX

Keep custom CSS under ~100 lines at launch (Pilot); avoid component re-styling unless necessary.
Defer all custom JS; avoid heavy libraries.
Lazy-load images via native attributes; prefer fixed image heights on cards to minimise layout shift.
Limit DOM changes to specific containers; avoid full-page swaps.

### Conventions

- Prefer Bootstrap utility classes over writing new CSS.
- Keep HTMX endpoints returning small, cache-friendly HTML fragments.
- Use concise, consistent microcopy for actions (e.g., Approve, Reject, Load more).
- Centralise any “flash” messages as Bootstrap toasts; trigger them via response headers (no global event bus).

### Testing considerations

- Verify keyboard-only flows for filtering, submitting, and moderating.
- Confirm that list updates, toasts, and confirm prompts behave consistently across modern browsers.
- Check that pages render and remain usable when JS is disabled (progressive enhancement).
- JavaScript testing to be used (however minimal).

### Risks & mitigations

- Drift toward heavier front-end code: review PRs to keep CSS/JS minimal; prefer Bootstrap utilities and server-rendered partials.
- UI regressions from ad or analytics scripts: load non-essential scripts after content, and monitor Core Web Vitals.
- Overuse of custom styles: document any additions; remove unused rules during iterations.

### Definition of done (for this section)

- Minimal CSS and JS files exist, documented, and loaded globally.
- Key pages (list, detail, submit, moderation) use Bootstrap defaults with minimal overrides.
- HTMX interactions are scoped, accessible, and progressively enhanced.
- No custom JS frameworks included; bundle remains small and deferrable.

## Anti-Abuse, Trust & Content Policy

- Cloudflare Turnstile on submit/report; `django-ratelimit` (e.g., 5/min/IP).
- Disallow approval if `guest_email` not verified.
- Profanity/banned words check (server-side list).
- Contact relay form hides organiser email (prevents scraping).
- Policy pages: Terms, Privacy, Content Guidelines (no hate speech, illegal content, scams, explicit content, counterfeit ticketing).
- If there are tickets required for an event, then a link to the official ticket seller will be provided.

## Privacy, GDPR & Legal

- Lawful basis: **Legitimate interests** (service provision) **+ Consent** (marketing emails/subscriptions).
- Store minimal organiser PII; never display raw emails; purge unneeded data.
- DSR (Data Subject Rights): export/delete on request; contact email published.
- Logs: store IPs for abuse reports up to 90 days; rotate logs.
- Cookies: essential only (session, CSRF); provide cookie notice if adding analytics.
